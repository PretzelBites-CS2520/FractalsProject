# FractalsProject
Turtle Drawing Fractals Project for CS2520
***
### Roadmap
- Generate different types of fractals using turtle
  - <ins>examples</ins>: Mandelbrot set, Koch Snowflake, Sierpinski Triangle, Julia set, ...
  - <ins>an easier example</ins>: Golden Ratio (technically not a fractal)
  - <ins>optional</ins>: Randomly generated fractals
- User customization
  - GUI for user to select the type of fractal
  - Color, size, scale, background
  - <ins>optional</ins>: ability to zoom
- messages / text
- more interactive options
- *more here*
***
### Known Issues
- May be difficult to make interactive GUI with just Turtle. Look into Tkinter
- koch snowflake implementation doesnt necessarily work as it should, looks fine for higher iterations but lower iterations dont work properly
