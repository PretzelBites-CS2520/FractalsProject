# FractalsProject
Turtle Drawing Fractals Project for CS2520

### Project Goal
> To create a visual representation of various fractals generated through math

### Usage Instructions
> Run main.py  
> No new module needs to be downloaded. The primary modules used are `turtle` and `tkinter`, both of which are already provided with python

***
### Roadmap
1. ~~Generate different types of fractals using turtle~~
    - ~~Examples: Mandelbrot Set, Koch Snowflake, Sierpinski Triangle, Basic Snowflake~~
    - ~~Optional / Experimental: Random Fractal~~
2. ~~User Customization~~
    - ~~GUI for user to select the type of fractal (optionally including images)~~
    - ~~GUI for the user to select color, iterations, text~~
    - ~~Buttons for user to interact with fractal generation (Draw, Reset, Invert, Back)~~
