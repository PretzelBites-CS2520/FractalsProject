# FractalsProject
Turtle Drawing Fractals Project for CS2520
***
### Roadmap
- Generate different types of fractals using turtle
  - <ins>examples</ins>: ~~Mandelbrot set, Koch Snowflake,~~ Sierpinski Triangle, Tree fractal, ...
  - <ins>an easier example</ins>: Golden Ratio (technically not a fractal)
  - <ins>optional</ins>: Randomly generated fractals (look into Chaos Game?)
- User customization
  - GUI for user to select the type of fractal
  - ~~Color~~, size, scale, ~~(?)background, # of iterations~~
  - <ins>optional</ins>: a way to choose which fractal through a separate "page" (with images of the fractals)
  - <ins>optional</ins>: ability to zoom
- messages / text
- more interactive options
- *more here*

### Known Issues
- May be difficult to make interactive GUI with just Turtle. Look into Tkinter
- Invert button multiple times makes fractal generation noticeably slower for Mandelbrot (may not be fixable? given nature of generating)
- ~~When pressing cancel on reset button, it conntinues from last turtle position~~
- ~~Text is not showing up (may be a minor issue?)~~
- ~~Sometimes random color generation creates strings that cause errors ex: bad color string: #f7c5a~~
